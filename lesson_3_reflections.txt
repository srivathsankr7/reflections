When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work in local?
To collabrate with others, parallel and multi user tasking

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid conflicts during collabration. To avoid pushing unwanted files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is to clone in git-hub. It is used when I want a copy of others repo which is in git-hub.
Clone is to make a copy. This can be used to take a local copy from my remote server(git-hub).
Branch is used when I want to do some experimental feature. It can be created in my local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It will help to work offline. We could take the latest and proceed working offline with latest code. We can even start merging and resolving conflicts if any.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Resolving conflicts, merging changes, working on experimental modules, code reviews would be harder.
Nothing will be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When my code should not affect the existing work flow.
When I work in an experimental proj.
When my changes has to be reviewed before going to production.
