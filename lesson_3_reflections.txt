When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work in local?
To collabrate with others, parallel and multi user tasking

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid conflicts during collabration. To avoid pushing unwanted files

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is to clone in git-hub. It is used when I want a copy of others repo which is in git-hub.
Clone is to make a copy. This can be used to take a local copy from my remote server(git-hub).
Branch is used when I want to do some experimental feature. It can be created in my local.
